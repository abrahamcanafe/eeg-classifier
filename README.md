# Decoding EEG Data with Deep Learning

Neural network electroencephalography (EEG) classifiers for the final project for Introduction to Deep Learning course at UCLA.

## Built With

* Written in Python
* Neural networks implemented using PyTorch

## Project Details

Various classification and data exploration tasks for the EEG dataset described in this [link](https://bbci.de/competition/iv/desc_2a.pdf) using models largely based on convolutional neural networks. More details are discussed in the [final report](https://github.com/abrahamcanafe/eeg-classifier/blob/main/Decoding_EEG_Data_with_Deep_Learning.pdf).
