# Decoding EEG Data with Deep Learning

Neural network classifiers for electroencephalography (EEG) data created in 2023 as the final project of the Introduction to Deep Learning course at UCLA.

## Built With

* Python
* Jupyter Notebook
* PyTorch

## Project Details

Various classification and data exploration tasks for the EEG dataset described in this [link](https://bbci.de/competition/iv/desc_2a.pdf) using models largely based on convolutional neural networks. More details are discussed in the [final report](https://github.com/abrahamcanafe/eeg-classifier/blob/main/Decoding_EEG_Data_with_Deep_Learning.pdf) and the [Jupyter Notebooks](https://github.com/abrahamcanafe/eeg-classifier/tree/main/eeg-classifier).

## Additional Notes

Unfortunately, the preprocessed EEG dataset used in this respository cannot be shared. The original EEG dataset can stil be found [here](https://bbci.de/competition/iv/desc_2a.pdf).
